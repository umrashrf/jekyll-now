title: Bonjour!

This is my first blog post of 2018. This is a classic Hello World except the title is French salutation and is my attempt to show off all the French I know :sunglasses:.

My main goal is to document and share my work experiences with the world but I'll try to make it an interesting read by also sharing my other experiences like sports, travel, food, etc.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
